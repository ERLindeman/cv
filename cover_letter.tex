\justifying

\text{I am excited to apply for the Support Engineer position at GitHub. With over three years of experience in technical support and system administration, along with a passion for helping developers, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team. My strong customer service skills, technical knowledge, and dedication to process improvement make me a great fit for this role.}
\\
\text{In my current role as an IT Support Specialist at Tolleson Union High School District, I handle a high volume of technical tickets related to device management, network issues, and user accounts. By developing an automated support app, I reduced ticket volume by 90\%, demonstrating my ability to improve processes and provide timely solutions. I am excited to bring my expertise in ticket handling and process optimization to GitHub, where I can help developers resolve issues quickly and efficiently.}
\\
\text{I am particularly drawn to GitHub’s mission to empower developers and foster collaboration. While I have experience supporting web apps, my proficiency in troubleshooting and customer advocacy aligns well with GitHub's focus on high-quality customer support. I am eager to expand my knowledge in GitHub's platform and continue growing as part of your team.}
\\
