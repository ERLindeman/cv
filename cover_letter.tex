\justifying
\noindent
\text{I am excited to apply for the Application Support role. With over 2 years of experience managing distributed systems, leading incident resolution efforts, and performing system upgrades on Red Hat Linux, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your team. My background in Hadoop administration (Cloudera, Spark, Hive) and experience in SDLC-based environments aligns with the responsibilities outlined in this role.} \\\\
\text{In my current role at by The Lindemans, I have led service implementations, managed deployments, and provided on-call support for critical systems. I am comfortable navigating complex systems, performing independent code upgrades, and coordinating with cross-functional stakeholders to resolve service disruptions. My ability to document Standard Operating Procedures and identify process improvements has consistently resulted in improved efficiency and reduced incident rates.} \\\\
\text{At Tolleson Union High School District, I implemented monitoring frameworks that improved issue detection and reduced resolution times. I have experience leading teams during service disruptions, collaborating with senior stakeholders, and ensuring operational continuity. This hands-on experience has prepared me to take ownership of incident management and make strategic decisions that align with business goals.} \\\\
\text{I look forward to the opportunity to bring my technical expertise and leadership skills to your team. Thank you for your time and consideration. I am eager to discuss how my background and experience can contribute to your organization.} \\\\
