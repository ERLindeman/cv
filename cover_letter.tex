\text{I am excited to apply for the Principal Software Engineer position at PTC, specifically on the Ada products development team. With over 5 years of professional software development experience in C, C++, and Ada, I have extensive expertise in designing and maintaining embedded compilers, runtime libraries, and real-time operating systems. My background in implementing robust, scalable solutions for mission-critical applications makes me an ideal candidate to contribute to PTC's cutting-edge Ada product line.} \\\\
\text{In my current role as a software developer at by The Lindemans, I designed and maintained Ada runtime libraries for embedded devices, managing product releases and builds for Linux and Unix platforms. I have hands-on experience with embedded systems in real-time operating environments such as VxWorks and LynxOS, which aligns well with the requirements of this position. Additionally, I have implemented CI/CD pipelines, automated release processes, and collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to deliver efficient and reliable embedded software solutions.} \\\\
\text{At Tolleson Union High School District, I developed and maintained embedded C/C++ applications, performing system diagnostics and hardware-software integration for real-time operations. These experiences, combined with my passion for solving complex technical challenges, position me to make a strong impact at PTC, particularly in maintaining and enhancing your Ada compilers and embedded systems.} \\\\
\text{I am particularly drawn to PTC's mission of bringing together the physical and digital worlds to empower businesses and improve operations. I would love the opportunity to contribute to this vision by applying my skills in embedded systems, compiler design, and real-time technologies to your Ada products team.} \\\\
