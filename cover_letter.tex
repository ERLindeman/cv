\justifying
\noindent
\text{I am excited to apply for the Jr. C++ Developer role at Ampcus Inc. With strong proficiency in C++, exceptional analytical abilities, and a passion for working with cutting-edge technology, I am eager to contribute to your team. The opportunity to analyze code responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT, GEMINI, and BERT aligns with my passion for both software development and linguistics, making this role an exciting next step in my career.} \\\\
\text{At by The Lindemans, LLC, I developed and optimized software solutions using C++ to enhance performance and usability. I gained experience writing clean, maintainable code while collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to ensure alignment with project goals. Additionally, I have worked on code review processes that strengthened my attention to detail and enhanced my ability to assess code quality and efficiency. These skills are directly transferable to the requirements of this role, where evaluating code responses from LLMs is a key focus.} \\\\
\text{In my role at Tolleson Union High School District, I further refined my communication skills, developing the ability to translate technical concepts for non-technical stakeholders. This experience will allow me to communicate effectively within your team and ensure that insights from the linguistic analysis of LLM outputs are both actionable and understandable. My analytical mindset and problem-solving skills have consistently enabled me to identify improvement opportunities within complex software systems.} \\\\
\text{I am particularly drawn to this role at Ampcus Inc. because of the unique intersection of software development, linguistics, and AI technology. I look forward to applying my skills in C++, code evaluation, and communication to support your teamâ€™s efforts in identifying the best-performing LLM models under various conditions.} \\\\
\text{Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my background and skills align with the goals of Ampcus Inc.}
