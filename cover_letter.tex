\justifying
\noindent
\text{I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Backend Engineer role at Stedi. With over four years of experience developing complex, large-scale web applications and APIs using AWS services, I am excited to contribute to Stedi’s mission of rebuilding the B2B economy’s technological backbone. I am particularly drawn to this opportunity because of Stedi’s innovative approach in offering API-first clearinghouses and my experience aligns well with the use of serverless technologies such as Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and more.} \\\\
\text{In my recent role as a Full-Stack Developer at by The Lindemans, LLC, I led the development of several customer-facing applications using AWS’s serverless architecture. I built scalable APIs with AWS Lambda, integrated them with services such as SQS and SNS, and automated infrastructure deployment using CDK (TypeScript), which aligns directly with the technologies used at Stedi. I have also worked extensively with Rust, which I used to build high-performance backend systems, and I have a solid understanding of how to leverage its capabilities for API development.} \\\\
\text{I am excited about the opportunity to work at Stedi because of its focus on revolutionizing the way businesses exchange mission-critical transactions. Stedi’s commitment to automation and eliminating toil resonates with me, and I look forward to contributing to a culture of engineering excellence by writing clean, scalable, and efficient code. My background in Rust, TypeScript, and AWS serverless offerings makes me well-suited to help Stedi achieve its goal of building the highest quality, broadest-reaching trading network at the lowest possible price for customers.} \\\\
\text{Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to the continued success of Stedi.}
