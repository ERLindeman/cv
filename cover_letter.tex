\justifying
\noindent
\text{I am writing to apply for the Jr. Software Engineer position at Alutiiq Information Management, LLC, where I am excited to contribute to the development of the Digital Additive Manufacturing Enterprise (DAME) project. With hands-on experience in Python, JavaScript, and full stack development, I am confident in my ability to help build secure, scalable applications for the Naval Information Warfare Command.} \\\\
\text{In my recent role as a Junior Full Stack Developer, I worked on both front-end and back-end systems, developing and maintaining web applications that meet security, performance, and scalability requirements. I have experience programming in Python for back-end development and JavaScript for front-end frameworks, as well as working with RESTful APIs and integrating them into cloud-native systems on AWS. I am also familiar with CI/CD practices, having implemented GitLab CI pipelines to automate builds, testing, and deployment.} \\\\
\text{I am particularly excited about the opportunity to contribute to a project that supports both CONUS and OCONUS naval operations through cutting-edge 3D printing and Product Lifecycle Management capabilities. I am eager to bring my skills in microservices architecture, containerization with Docker, and secure coding practices to the DAME project and the Alutiiq team.} \\\\
\text{Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my skills can contribute to the success of the DAME project and your team.} \\\\
