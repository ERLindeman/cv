\justifying

\text{I am writing to express my interest in the Technical Support Engineer position at Coralogix. With a strong background in cloud infrastructure (AWS, Kubernetes, Docker) and observability tools (Kibana, Prometheus, Grafana), along with over five years of experience in technical support roles, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your global support team. My mission is to empower customers through innovative technology solutions, perfectly aligning with Coralogix's approach to driving operational efficiency and reducing observability costs.} \\\\
\text{In my current role as a Technology Support Specialist at Tolleson Union High School District, I manage cloud-based systems for over 14,000 users, overseeing end-to-end deployment, troubleshooting, and user account security. I have also developed solutions like a Microsoft Power App, reducing support requests by over 90\%. My ability to streamline processes and support large-scale operations will enable me to deliver value to Coralogix's customers as they adopt and expand your platform.} \\\\
\text{Though I am still developing my expertise in advanced observability and security analytics, my hands-on experience with scripting, cloud services, and complex troubleshooting gives me a strong foundation to quickly adapt and master the tools Coralogix utilizes, including ELK stack and PromQL. I am a fast learner, eager to take on new challenges in observability and continuously grow my technical skills.} \\\\
\text{What excites me most about joining Coralogix is your innovative approach to reducing observability costs and the collaborative, customer-centric culture you foster. I am particularly inspired by your mission to push the boundaries of observability, which resonates deeply with my goal to help businesses harness technology to optimize their operations.} \\\\
\text{I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to bring my technical support expertise and cloud operations experience to Coralogix. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team and supporting your customers in their journey to transform how they monitor and understand their data. Thank you for considering my application. I am excited to discuss how I can contribute to Coralogixâ€™s continued success.}
