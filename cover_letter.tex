I am excited about the opportunity to be part of a company that drives sales enablement through collaborative technology and continuous guidance.} \\\\
\text{In my role as an IT Support Specialist at Tolleson Union High School District, I built a Microsoft Power App that integrated with Office365 and SharePoint, reducing user support requests by over 90\%. I also have experience developing process automation solutions that streamline workflows, enhance user experience, and drive efficiency—all critical to Seismic's mission of optimizing business outcomes through technology integration. My skills in SQL, data analysis, and system administration would directly support Seismic's operational needs.} \\\\
\text{Although I am still building expertise with tools like Workato and NetSuite, I am eager to learn and adapt quickly to Seismic's suite of financial technologies. My foundation in Python, RESTful APIs, and process automation has given me a strong platform to master these tools and contribute to Seismic’s integration and automation goals effectively. I am confident that my proactive approach and passion for continuous improvement align with Seismic's commitment to fostering a culture of belonging and growth.} \\\\
