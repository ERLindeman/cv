Fajita Seasoning
2 T Garlic Powder
1 T Cayenne (or to taste)
1 T Onion Powder
2 Â½ T Paprika
1 T  Oregano
1 T Pepper
1 T Thyme
2 T Salt

Mix dried spices together and store in container of your choice.  Use to season your meat.  

The great thing about fajitas is that you can make them however your family likes. I cook fajitas with 1 red onion and 2 bell peppers (red and yellow) all cut into thin strips.  Saute veggies first, set aside. Saute, or grill, seasoned meat then add veggies back and rewarm if needed. Top with sour cream, avocados, salsa, cheese...whatever your family likes.
