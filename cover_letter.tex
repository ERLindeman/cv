\text{I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer position on the Qualcomm Global CAD team. With extensive experience in C++ and Python, along with a strong background in algorithm development and database optimization, I am eager to contribute to your cutting-edge projects focused on improving the SoC design infrastructure for Snapdragon chips. My passion for tackling complex software challenges and my ability to collaborate with cross-functional teams align perfectly with Qualcomm’s innovative environment.} \\\\
\text{In my current role at by The Lindemans, I have developed backend tools using C++ and Python for high-performance systems. I created efficient algorithms for data processing, reducing query times by 30\%, and implemented database solutions that ensured optimal performance even during high-traffic periods. My hands-on experience in developing infrastructure tools aligns closely with the Qualcomm Global CAD team's efforts to reduce design cycle times and optimize chip performance.} \\\\
\text{During my tenure at Tolleson Union High School District, I led the development of CAD tools for chip design, improving design cycle time by 15\% through automation and efficient flow management. This experience, combined with my solid background in C++ and Python, positions me to make significant contributions to Qualcomm’s goals of enhancing Snapdragon chips’ power, speed, and area efficiency.} \\\\
\text{I am particularly excited about Qualcomm’s mission to push the limits of flow architecture and database solutions for Snapdragon chips. I would love the opportunity to apply my technical skills and passion for innovation to help Qualcomm achieve its goals. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills align with your team’s needs.} \\\\
